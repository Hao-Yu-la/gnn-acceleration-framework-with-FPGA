# Code Style

We use pre-commit hook to make sure the code is aligned with the writing standard. To set up the code style checking, you need to follow the steps below.

```shell
# these commands are executed under the gnn-acceleration-framework-with-FPGA directory
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Code format checking will be automatically executed when you commit your changes.
