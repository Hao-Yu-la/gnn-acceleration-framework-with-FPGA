# GNN acclerator simulator

A simulator for verifying the correctness of instructions generated by the compiler.

## Usage
From the python api
```
from compiler.simulator.simulator import run_simulator
run_simulator($input_folder, $ref_result_dir, $dump_ddr_addr)
```
The $input_folder should contain adj.bin, bias.bin, feature.bin, instructions.bin and weight.bin.

The $ref_result_dir is the true output .npy file of the tested network.

The $dump_ddr_addr is optional, you can assign the ddr start address you want to dump, dumped size is determined by the size of data $ref_result_dir. If you don't set it, the default value is set to dram_start_address of the last executed save inst.

## Example
```
from compiler.simulator.simulator import run_simulator
run_simulator("./compiler/result/sage-mean-2-16-enzymes-compiled", "./compiler/IR_and_data/sage-mean-2-16-enzymes/feat7.npy")
```
